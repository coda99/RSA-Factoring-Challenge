# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

The RSA Factoring Challenge was a challenge put forward by RSA Laboratories on March 18, 1991 to encourage research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in cryptography.

# Problem Statement By Julien Barbier on behalf of ALX Africa
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

    p and q are always prime numbers
    There is only one number in the files

How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
