# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

This is my implementation of the optional RSA-Factoring-Challenge given by Julien Barbier on behalf of ALX Africa
The task is to write an algorithm that can attempt solving the rsa challange put up by RSA Laboratories on March 18, 1991.
You can read more about the challenge here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge]
I have decided to try writing my algorithm with the Python Programming langauge
